# Test Exercise

## Overview
This repository, **test-exercise**, contains a collection of automated test cases written using the **Page Object Model (POM)** structure. The test cases are designed for multiple websites, demonstrating a structured and maintainable approach to web testing.

## Project Structure
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Each test case follows the POM structure, separating the test logic from the user interface elements. This structure ensures that the tests are more readable, reusable, and maintainable.
- **Multiple Website Testing**: Test cases are implemented for various websites, each following the POM structure to demonstrate flexibility and scalability across different web applications.

## Features
- **Modular and Maintainable Code**: With the POM structure, each page has its own class, which makes the code modular and easy to maintain.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new test cases for different websites by simply creating new page classes.
- **Reusable Components**: Reuse common functionalities across multiple test cases.

## Requirements
To run the tests in this repository, make sure the following dependencies are installed:
- **Java**
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **TestNG**
